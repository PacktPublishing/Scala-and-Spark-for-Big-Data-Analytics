# Scala and Spark for Big Data Analytics
This is the code repository for [Scala and Spark for Big Data Analytics](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/scala-and-spark-big-data-analytics?utm_source=GitHub), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book is divided into three parts. In the first part, it will introduce you to Scala programming, helping you understand its fundamentals and be able to program with Spark. It will then move on to introducing you to Spark and the design choices beneath it and show you how to perform data analysis with it. Finally, to shake things up, the book moves on to Advanced Spark and teaches you advanced topics, such as monitoring, configuration, debugging, testing, and finally deployment.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
package com.chapter11.SparkMachineLearning
import org.apache.spark.mllib.feature.StandardScalerModel
import org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.{ Vector, Vectors }
import org.apache.spark.sql.{ DataFrame }
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession
```

To follow this book, you need basic to medium-level knowledge of the Java programming language. A basic knowledge of concurrency concepts is welcome too.
